# GOTV-autonomy-public
repo for data and code sharing for paper: "Autonomy as civic motivation: Associations between autonomy and civic duty, civic action, and voting"


The main analyses can be replicated using `main_analyses.Rmd` (which pulls data from `data_merged.csv`, which has scored scales and `data_unscored.csv`, which has raw scale data as items for some analyses). Some figures are saved out directly in the script, and are output to the `figs` folder.  

The supplemental analyses including voter verfication and models with demographic data cannot be replicated, because sharing the data would violate participant privacy. However, we share the code used for these analyses (`analyses_with_demographics.Rmd`).
